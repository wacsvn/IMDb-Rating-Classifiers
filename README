# Summary 
This project aims to explore machine learning methods and their development processes by training on an IMDb ratings dataset to predict whether a user had a positive or negative sentiment towards a given movie. In this project we utilized kNN, Logistic Regression, Feedforward Neural Network, and Random Forest models to identify the most accurate fit. Ultimately, the Logistic Regression and Random Forest models performed the best, the latter being slightly less generalizable to new data. 

Note that this repo contains code for the dataset visualizations, as well as Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers, but does not include the kNN or Feedforward Neural Network classifiers. Additionally, in order to reproduce these results, the original dataset will have to be downloaded first from the link at the top of this README. 

# Data Description
The dataset we used, ‘IMDb Movie Reviews’, is a sentiment analysis dataset containing over 50,000 binary (positive or negative) responses in the form of reviews from the Internet Movie Database. The dataset only contains polarizing reviews, meaning neutral ratings were not included. Other measures were taken to ensure the data wasn’t too heavily biased, such as limiting the number of reviews allowed for a single movie to 30. The source website also links to a Stanford publication that uses this dataset, entitled “Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis”, which expands to an even larger dataset to serve as a robust benchmark.
